# How to start the project!


 Make sure you have NPM on your working environment
 

 Clone project from Github: https://github.com/nkarimovic/async_frontend.git
 

 After you  have successfully cloned the project into a repository:

  ### `cd <project_directory>`
  ### `npm install`
  ### `npm run server`
  
  After that move to react directory "client" (open a new terminal so that server process is still open):
  ### `cd client`
  ### `yarn build`
  ### `npm install -g serve`
  ### `serve -s build`
